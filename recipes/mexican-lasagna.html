    <h1>Mexican Lasagna - Without Noodles!</h1>
    <img src="mexican-lasagna.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a traditional dish in my family. Anyone can make it really. 
        It is composed of traditional Mexican ingredients layered over the top of one another in a lasagna-like fashion (hence the name) 
        but has little similarity to lasagna, so lasagna haters have no fear!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ground Beef</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Water</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Taco Seasoning</strong> 1 packet will do</li>
        <li><strong>Tortillas</strong> Use as many as desired</li>
        <li><strong>Refried Beans</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with classic Mexican refried beans</li> 
        <li><strong>Shredded Colby-Jack Cheese</strong> 4 cups will do</li>   
        <li><strong>Taco Sauce</strong> Make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Gather</em><strong> all</strong><strong><em> your</em></strong> ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground beef. Cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Drain and discard any excess grease. Add water and taco seasoning; cook and stir until mixture has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Arrange 3 tortillas in the bottom of the casserole dish; spread about half the can of refried beans and half the ground beef atop the tortilla layer.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over ground beef layer. Arrange 3 more tortillas over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Spread in the remaining 1/2 can refried beans and half the jar of taco sauce; sprinkle with 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese.</li>
        <li>Arrange 3 more tortillas and top with remaining ground beef and 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese. Top with last 3 tortillas and remaining 1/2 jar taco sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top tortilla layer begins to brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over lasagna.</li>
        <li>Turn on oven's broiler</li>
        <li>Place lasagna under the broiler until Colby-Jack cheese is melted and bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
